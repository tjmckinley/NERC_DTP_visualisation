R has fantastic graphical capabilities. You can produce almost **any** type of plot you like in R, and customise it in almost any way; although to do so may require quite a lot of coding!
    
To this end many great visualisation packages have been developed to produce a wide variety of different plots applicable to a wide range of data types. We will explore the use of one specific package---[`ggplot2`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)---in the later [Advanced Visualisation](#advis) practical. In the meantime, just to illustrate some ideas, we can produce some very simple plots quite easily using R's base graphics capabilities. 

## Simple plots

### Scatterplots

As an illustration, we return to the fruitflies data set we saw [earlier](#fruitflies) from [Partridge and Farquhar (1981)](https://www.nature.com/articles/294580a0). The plot in the original paper is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:fruitflies) and we will replicate this here.

```{r, fruitflies, fig.cap = "Plot of fruitfly data stratified by experimental group", out.width = '60%', echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("intro/images/fruitflies.png")
```

The simplest way to produce a scatterplot is to use R's generic `plot()` function. Here we will plot lifespan (`longevity`) against thorax length (`thorax`) from the fruitfly experiment data set we saw previously. `r ifelse(!is_latex_output(), "For ease, the tidied 'ff.rds' file can be downloaded from [here](intro/uploadFiles/ff.rds).", "")`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## read in the data
ff <- readRDS("ff.rds")
summary(ff)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## read in the data
ff <- readRDS("intro/uploadFiles/ff.rds")
summary(ff)
```

```{r}
## extract controls only
ffc <- ff[ff$partner.type == "Control", ]

## produce a scatter plot for just controls
plot(ffc$thorax, ffc$longevity)
```

Here we passed `ffc$thorax` as the `x` argument, and `ffc$longevity` as the `y` argument to `plot()`, and we can see that R has produced a scatterplot by default. It does this because it knows you are trying to plot a `numeric` vector against another `numeric` vector, and so this is a sensible default. **Note that we have extracted the controls only into a new data set `ffc` for ease-of-use.**

You will notice that the plot is not very neat. There are some arguments that we can add to help improve the axis labels and suchlike, e.g.

```{r}
## produce a scatter plot
plot(ffc$thorax, ffc$longevity, 
     xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", ylab = "Longevity (days)",
     main = "Control experiment")
```


```{task}
Try setting the `pch` argument to `plot()` and see what it does. Take a look at the help file for scatterplots e.g. `?plot` (choose the option from the `graphics` library).
```

```{solution}
Here `pch` changes the point type. For example:
    
``{r}
plot(ffc$thorax, ffc$longevity, 
    xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", ylab = "Longevity (days)", 
    main = "Control experiment", pch = 20)
``

```

There are some functions that allow us to **add to**, or **overlay**, existing plots. As an example, let's say we want to plot the data for **males housed with one female**, and then colour each point in the plot according to `partner.type` type (equivalent to the top-right figure in Figure \@ref(fig:fruitflies)). One way to do this is to produce a plot with all points on it (this helps to set the axis ranges correctly), and then overlay different points according to different subsets of the data. We can use the `points()` function to do this.

\newpage
        
```{r, plotff, eval = FALSE}
## extract subset of data
ffone <- ff[ff$partners == "1", ]

## produce scatterplot
plot(ffone$thorax, ffone$longevity, 
     xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", ylab = "Longevity (days)", 
     main = "Males kept with one partner", pch = 20)

## overlay points according to inseminated females
points(ffone$thorax[ffone$partner.type == "Inseminated"], 
       ffone$longevity[ffone$partner.type == "Inseminated"], 
       pch = 20, col = "red")
```

```{r, ref.label = "plotff", echo = FALSE}
```

\newpage 

Notice there is no legend, we have to add that manually using the `legend()` function. The first two arguments are the $x$- and $y$-coordinates for the top left corner of the legend box. Here we manually set the corresponding point characters (`pch`) and colours (`col`) and add the appropriate legend text (`legend`):
    
```{r, plotff1, eval = FALSE}
## add legend
legend(0.65, 95, pch = rep(20, 2), 
       col = c("black", "red"), 
       legend = c("Virgin", "Inseminated"))
```

```{r, ref.label = c("plotff", "plotff1"), echo = FALSE}
```

```{task, title = "Question"}
Say we wished to use different point characters---rather than different colours---to represent the different `partner` types. Why would it be difficult to use `points()` na&iuml;vely here to do this?
```

```{solution, title = "Answer"}
Because `points()` will **overlay** the original set of points, which might have a different point type, and thus won't look as you want it to look. For example:

``{r}
## produce scatterplot
plot(ffone$thorax, ffone$longevity, 
    xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", ylab = "Longevity (days)", 
    main = "Males kept with one partner", pch = 20)

## overlay points according to inseminated females
points(ffone$thorax[ffone$partner.type == "Inseminated"], 
    ffone$longevity[ffone$partner.type == "Inseminated"], 
    pch = 1)
``

```

There are various ways you can circumvent this behaviour, and one way is simply to pass a `vector` of point characters to the original `plot()` call, rather than use `points()`.
        
```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
You can set a vector of point characters or colours, where the vector is the same length as the number of points you want to plot, and each entry defines the relevant colour or character for a given point.

Previously we have set a single number, e.g. `pch = 20`, which R automatically expands to a vector "beneath-the-hood". However, we can have more fine-grained control over the way the points are plotted by using vectors where appropriate.
```

\newpage
    
```{r}
## create vector of initial point characters
temp_pch <- rep(20, nrow(ffone))

## set point characters for all entries not
## partnered with virgin partners
temp_pch[ffone$partner.type != "Virgin"] <- 1

## produce plot (notice that only the controls are plotted
## but the axes are correct)
plot(ffone$thorax, ffone$longevity, 
     xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", 
     ylab = "Longevity (days)", 
     main = "Males kept with one partner", 
     pch = temp_pch)

## add legend
legend(0.65, 95, pch = c(20, 1), legend = c("Virgin", "Inseminated"))
```

\newpage

Note that R will try to be clever if you pass different types of object into the `plot()` function. For example:
    
```{r}
## produce a plot of longevity against partner type
plot(ff$partner.type, ff$longevity, xlab = "Partner type", ylab = "Longevity (days)")
```

You can see here that since the `x` argument is a `factor` and the `y` argument is ` numeric`, then by default R produces a box-and-whisker plot of longevity with each partner group.

```{task}
What happens if you swap the order of the arguments in the plot above?
```

```{solution}
Here R hasn't been quite so clever this time. Since the `y` value is now a `factor` R has now converted this into a `numeric` type (see [here](#factconv)) and then produced a scatterplot; which is perhaps less useful here.

``{r}
plot(ff$longevity, ff$partner.type, ylab = "Partner type", xlab = "Longevity (days)")
``

```

### Line plots

As a simple example of a line plot we can use some data from [Diggle (1990)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/time-series-9780198522263?cc=gb&lang=en&) on monthly deaths from bronchitis, emphysema and asthma in the UK, between 1974--1979. The data are contained in the file `ldeaths.csv``r ifelse(!is_latex_output(), ", which can be downloaded from [here](intro/uploadFiles/ldeaths.csv)", "")`. Make sure it is downloaded to the working directory.

Firstly we load in the data:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## load lung disease data set
ldeaths <- read.csv("ldeaths.csv")
summary(ldeaths)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
## load lung disease data set
ldeaths <- read.csv("intro/uploadFiles/ldeaths.csv")
summary(ldeaths)
```

```{r}
head(ldeaths)
```

```{info, title = "Aside", collapsible = FALSE}
We can see that the `date` column has been read in as a `character` vector, which is what we expect given the input file. However, R has a special data type that can be used to store and manipulate dates. This is very helpful when we want to plot, since it can automatically capture the correct ordering. There are also various base R functions that can manipulate dates (for example, if you want to extract the month or year say, or find the time difference bewteen two dates). A neat recent package is [`lubridate`](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/), which is part of the `tidyverse`. We will use some of its functionality in the future, but here we just need to use a base R function called `as.Date()` to convert the `date` column into a `Date` object. The `format = "%d-%m-%Y"` argument tells `as.Date()` the structure of the input (`%Y` = four digit year, `%m` = two digit month, `%d` = two digit day, all seperated by hyphens (`-`)).

``{r}
## convert character to date
ldeaths$date <- as.Date(ldeaths$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
summary(ldeaths)
``

```

Now we can produce a line plot for the monthly deaths per male by using `plot()` as before, but this time setting `type = "l"` e.g.

```{r}
## line plot of deaths over time for males
plot(ldeaths$date[ldeaths$sex == "male"],
    ldeaths$deaths[ldeaths$sex == "male"], type = "l")
```

We can use the `lty` argument to change the line type e.g.

```{r}
## line plot of deaths over time for males
plot(ldeaths$date[ldeaths$sex == "male"],
    ldeaths$deaths[ldeaths$sex == "male"], type = "l", lty = 2)
```

When plotting multiple groups it is a better idea to use the `lines()` function to add new lines to existing plots. This is because if you simply try expand `lty` to be different for different groups, then you can get unwanted behaviour.

```{task}
Produce a plot of deaths against date, but pass a vector to `lty`, where each element of the vector is a `1` for males and `2` for females. What happens and why?
```

```{solution}

``{r}
## PROBLEMATIC line plot of deaths over time for males
plot(ldeaths$date, ldeaths$deaths, type = "l", lty = ifelse(ldeaths$sex == "male", 1, 2))
``

Here the lines are joined in order, so the beginning of the male line is joined to the end of the female line. Furthermore the change in line-type is ignored. This is because there is nothing in the code to say the lines are separate, and so R treats the co-ordinates as defining one line, and thus there can only be one line type.
```

The code below shows a better solution, but note that you have to manually expand the $y$-axis when calling `plot()`, since the `male` and `female` subgroups have different ranges[^ranges].

```{r}
## better line plot of deaths over time for males
plot(ldeaths$date[ldeaths$sex == "male"], 
     ldeaths$deaths[ldeaths$sex == "male"], type = "l",
     ylim = range(ldeaths$deaths))
lines(ldeaths$date[ldeaths$sex == "female"], 
     ldeaths$deaths[ldeaths$sex == "female"], lty = 2)
```

[^ranges]: the `range(x)` function here returns a vector of minimum and maximum values from the input vector `x`

This looks better. Note that as before we can tidy up the axis labels and also add a legend. Note that there is not really enough space on the plot above for a legend, so I have manually extended the `ylim` range a bit more to allow for it. (I've also set the legend $x$-location using a different date format, just to illustrate how you can adapt the code in case you have dates stored in a different format---see `?strptime` for more examples.)

```{r}
## better line plot of deaths over time for males
plot(ldeaths$date[ldeaths$sex == "male"], 
     ldeaths$deaths[ldeaths$sex == "male"], type = "l",
     ylim = c(min(ldeaths$deaths), 3000),
     xlab = "Date", ylab = "Number of deaths")
lines(ldeaths$date[ldeaths$sex == "female"], 
     ldeaths$deaths[ldeaths$sex == "female"], lty = 2)
legend(as.Date("01/01/1977", format = c("%d/%m/%Y")), 3000,
       lty = 1:2, legend = c("Males", "Females"))
```

## Multiple plots

We can also arrange multiple plots by using a function `par()` to set some plotting parameters. There are lots of options you can set with `par()`, but we will just use one called `mfrow`, which sets up a grid, where each element of the grid can contain a separate plot. We will try to replicate Figure \@ref(fig:fruitflies). (I've used a loop here for brevity, but you could do each plot explicitly):
    
```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, out.width = "70%"}
## set up 2 x 2 grid of plots
## (mfrow takes a vector with number of
## rows and number of columns)
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))

## plot controls
plot(ffc$thorax, ffc$longevity, pch = 20,
     xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", 
     ylab = "Longevity (days)", 
     main = "Controls",
     xlim = range(ff$thorax),
     ylim = range(ff$longevity))

titles <- c("One partner", "Eight partners")
partners <- c("1", "8")
for(i in 1:length(titles)) {
    ## extract subset of data
    temp <- ff[ff$partners == partners[i], ]
    
    ## create vector of initial point characters
    temp_pch <- rep(20, nrow(temp))
    
    ## turn off point characters for all entries not
    ## in the virgin
    temp_pch[temp$partner.type != "Virgin"] <- 1
    
    ## produce plot (notice that only the controls are plotted
    ## but the axes are correct)
    plot(temp$thorax, temp$longevity, 
         xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", 
         ylab = "Longevity (days)", 
         main = titles[i],
         xlim = range(ff$thorax),
         ylim = range(ff$longevity), 
         pch = temp_pch)
    
    ## add legend
    legend(0.65, 95, pch = c(20, 1), legend = c("Virgin", "Inseminated"))
}
## reset par
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

You can see that we can do an awful lot with base R graphics, but the code can become verbose very quickly. Notice we haven't added trend lines to the plot either, and have doubled-up on the legends. Often we have to manually extend the margins in order to fit legends in (though we were fine here). In the next practical we will see that with the right packages we can produce something better in just a few lines of code.

## Other common plots

Just to finish off this introduction, note that R has various other plot functions. A **line** plot can be drawn by setting e.g. `plot(x, y, type = "l")`, or added to an existing plot using the `lines()` function or `abline()`. Bar plots can also be generated (see `?barplot()`). **Histograms** can be plotted using `hist()` e.g.

```{r}
## histogram of thorax lengths
hist(ff$thorax, xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", main = "")
```

and some objects automatically have their own plot method. For example, to do a **kernel density plot** you can run the `density()` function on some data, and then `plot()` the resulting object e.g.

\newpage

```{r}
## kernel density plot of thorax lengths
plot(density(ff$thorax), xlab = "Thorax length (mm)", main =)
```

In fact, many non-standard R objects have their own `plot()` method, which is utilised by developers to provide important plot types that are specific to certain objects (for example, a **linear regression** can be fitted using the `lm()` function, and if the resulting object is passed to `plot()`, then this returns a suite of **residual** plots that are fundamental to checking the model etc.)

In this course we are going to focus on plotting **data**, and we will cover the use of a very powerful and flexible package called `ggplot2` in the next practical.

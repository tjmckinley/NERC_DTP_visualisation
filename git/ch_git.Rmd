# Version control {#version-control}

Our reproducible research journey has taken us from basic script files to fully annotated electronic notebooks using R Markdown. There is one final piece of the puzzle missing. How do we deal with **changes** done to our source code? 

A common approach is to create a new version of the file before making any changes.

```{r version-disaster, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Life before version control.", out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/version_disaster.png")
```

Some even document the changes in the header of the source code:

```

```

Although these approaches are certainly better than nothing, things get out of control pretty quickly: 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The \"final\" document. Reproduced from [PhD Comics](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1531).", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/final_doc.png")
```

**Version control systems** are software that track changes done to a set of files over time in a systematic fashion, such that previous versions can be easily accessed and compared. In a nutshell, these systems start with a **base** version of the file and then record any changes done along the way. Effectively, we have a **fossil record** that captures the evolution of the source code.

Version control systems are not a novel idea. They have been around at least since [1973](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System). However, these tools were predominantly used by software engineers. It is only recently that such software has become a mainstay for reproducible research; thanks to easy-to-use and open-source software like [Git](https://git-scm.com/). But also because it became a necessity, as scientists are dealing with ever-increasing large and complex datasets, requiring several computer programs to wrangle, visualise and model the data. Compare this to the "good old days" when datasets were simpler and could be analysed by "hand" or using spreadsheets.

Having this **fossil history**, that lets you access any version of your code between the start of the project and the present day, has several advantages:

* **Your code isn't working as it used to.** Go back to the last working version, then carefully add and step through the new additions. For large software projects [unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) is recommended. 

* **You deleted some code that in hindsight was useful and you want it back.** Instead of commenting out unused code, version control systems encourage you to "delete" it, so that the source code is shorter and more readable. However, you can simply access this "deleted" code by viewing (and reverting back to) an older version.

* **You want to experiment without worrying about breaking the rest of your code.** Statistical analysis / modelling is an iterative process, requiring the use of different models and techniques. By committing different versions of your analysis, you can retrieve whichever version ends up being your "final" one. Even better, you can use [**branching**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) to keep track of different strands of your analysis. For example, creating a separate branch for frequentist, Bayesian and machine learning treatment of the same data. All three branches would share the same data wrangling and visualisation code, which would be part of the **main** branch.

* **Effective and transparent collaboration among a group of people.** Through the use of online repositories, like [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), multiple people can work on the same source code without having to email code back and forth.

* **Access to an auditable project history** You know exactly when / what / why you did something. This is particularly useful for paper writing; to keep track of changes done in response to reviewers comments, or if someone challenges the results of the paper several months after it has been published (when most probably you'd have forgotten exactly what you did and why).

I recommend reading [this article](https://peerj.com/preprints/3159v2/) for further insights to why version control is useful for statistical / data science projects.

```{info, title = "Warning", collapsible = FALSE}
Version control systems are not a backup system! Although it is fairly common for users to host their version-controlled repositories online, this is not always the case or even necessary, so make sure you perform *regular* backups of your projects.
```

## Git

[**Git**](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open source **distributed version control system** created by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) (creator of the Linux kernel) in 2005. Currently, it is the most widely used version control system. 

Using **Git** can feel overwhelming, due to the various functionality available. The aim of this chapter is to provide a rather gentle introduction to get you started by presenting the key features.

Specifically, how to create and configure a Git repository and commit changes done to your code. We will then look at how to link a local Git repository to an online repository using GitHub. Finally, we will look at how we can use Git straight from within RStudio. But keep in mind that Git is a standalone tool, it's got nothing to do with R!

Once you are comfortable with the basics of Git, I recommend the following literature to become more proficient users. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is also a brilliant resource to answer any Git-related queries. 

* [Software Carpentry: Version Control with Git ](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* [Git's Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc)
* [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/)

### Installing Git

Git comprises a suite of **command-line utility tools**, designed to work on a Unix-style command-line environment (e.g. [`bash`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))). This is the default environment for Mac / Linux users (accessed via the **Terminal** app). Windows users need to install **Git Bash**, which essentially emulates `bash` on Windows. 

To install Git (and GitBash for Windows users), follow the relevant instructions on the [downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page (use the default options).

To make sure installation was successful open the following application:

* Windows users: **Git Bash**
* Mac / Linux users: **Terminal**

And type `$ git --version`

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
The `$` prefix does **not** need to be typed in. It's there to remind you that these are `bash` commands and not R commands, so they need to be typed in the **terminal console** (via Git Bash if you are a Windows user) and *not* in the R console.
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Display Git version on Windows using Git Bash.", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/git_version_win.png")
```

To follow the rest of this section you do not necessarily need to know `bash`, however, it's good to learn some basic commands, especially [navigating](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/02-filedir/index.html) and [working](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/03-create/index.html) with files and directories.

### Configuring Git

Git commands are structured as follows:

```
$ git verb options
```

Where:

* `verb` is the particular **action** you want Git to perform.
* `options` are additional **arguments** passed to the action you are performing.

The first step is to specify your **user name** and **email address**, so that any changes done to the source code can be traced back to an individual user. This is particularly useful for projects with multiple people.

```
$ git config --global user.name "Jon Snow"
$ git config --global user.email "jon.snow@nightwatch.com"
```

The `--global` flag is setting these credentials *globally*, i.e. for every Git project. So we only need to set these options once per machine^[If we wanted to differentiate between personal and work related projects we could use different credentials for each project, but that's beyond the scope of this introductory course.].

You can view the Git settings on your machine using:

```
$ git config --list
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
Later on in this course we will be using the online repository [GitHub](https://github.com/). It's best to create an account now and set your Git `user.email` to the same one used when setting up your [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. As this is a tool that you will probably use after leaving the university, I would use a personal email address.
```

### Creating a local Git repository

Now that we have installed and configured Git, we need to tell Git, *which* folder contains files that we want to track (we certainly do not want to track changes to every file on our computer)!

Let us create a folder called `first_repo` on our `Desktop`, and create an empty text file called `hello.txt`. We can do this "manually" or by executing the following `bash` commands:

```
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir first_repo
$ cd first_repo
$ touch hello.txt
```

To tell Git to make `first_repo` a local Git repository, i.e. a place to store different versions of our files, we use the following command:

```
$ git init
```

If successful you will see the following notification:

```
Initialized empty Git repository in /path/to/your/repository/.git/
```

```{info, title = "Warning", collapsible = FALSE}
Before running the `$ git init` command, make sure you have navigated to the right directory. Use the command `$ pwd` to print your current working directory to be sure.
```

The `git init` command will create a **hidden** directory called `.git` (you can view it by enabling showing of hidden files in your file manager or by typing `$ ls -a`). This folder stores **all** of the tracked information about changes done to the files within that project. If you delete the `.git` folder you will lose your fossil history---so do **not** touch this folder!

The `.git` folder is what makes an otherwise "normal" directory on your computer become a Git **repository** (repo for short). One of Git's key features is that the repo (i.e. the `.git` folder), contains the *entire* history of the project. If you move / clone this repo onto a new computer (e.g. a collaborator's computer), the full project history moves with it. This is called [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control) version control.

### Tracking changes

Let us check the status of our newly created repository:

```
$ git status
```

You should see something like this:

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        hello.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
Notice that the first line says `On branch main`. Git enables you to create different versions of your repo in different **branches**. This is ***very*** useful for lots of reasons. We will look at branching a bit more [later on](#branching). 
    
For the time being note that Git creates a **default branch** which is called `main` here. In older versions of Git, the default branch was called `master`, although this was recently changed to choose terminology that is more inclusive and considerate. 

If you have a version of Git sets this up as `master`, then you can simply replace `main` for `master` where appropriate in the code below. Otherwise, you can rename the branch using:
    
``
$ git branch -M main
``

```

So far we have only told git to "watch out" for files in the `first_repo` folder, but we haven't explicitly started tracking them. Hence, the "untracked files" message.

To instruct git to start **tracking** `hello.txt` we use the `add` command:

```
$ git add hello.txt
```

If we check the status of our repository (`$ git status`), we now see this:

```
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   hello.txt
```

The next and final step is to tell Git to take a *snapshot* of `hello.txt` and record (permanently) these changes as a **commit**.

```
$ git commit -m "First draft of hello.txt."
```

```
[main (root-commit) b3915e3] First draft of hello.txt.
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

Each **commit** is essentially a different version of your file and has a unique identifier associated with it (`b3915e3` in the example above---more on that later). These different versions are stored in the `.git` folder and maintained systematically by the Git version control system. Note that we did **not** need to create new copies of these files, like depicted in Fig \@ref(fig:version-disaster). Git takes care of everything for us---nice! 

The `-m` flag (for "message") is arguably the most important part of our version control exercise. The commit **message** should provide a succinct description of **what changed** and **why**. The clearer our commit messages are, the easier it is to "scroll" back through our changes to pinpoint specific versions. I highly recommend reading this article about writing [good Git commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

What we have described in this section is the so called **modify-add-commit cycle**, and represents the most routine use of Git (`add` and `commit` are the bread-and-butter commands of Git):

1. Modify a file.
2. Add it to the staging area (file(s) that are going to be part of the next commit).
3. Commit and document change.
4. If required, push changes to an online repository (more on that later on).

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Version control using Git in a nutshell.", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/git_info.png")
```

**How often should you commit changes?** 

It is better to have *several* small commits (even if it's one or two lines of code) than fewer large ones. Each commit should be self-contained and only tackling one specific thing. For example, suppose you were asked to change the aesthetics of one of your exploratory plots *and* fitting an additional statistical model. Such changes should be documented using two separate commits rather than one. The problems with large commits are:

* The commit message will become increasingly *verbose*. If your message includes words like "and" or "also", then you should probably split those commits.

* Debugging becomes a nightmare, as it is harder to track down the *order* that changes were made.

* For collaborative projects, it increases the chance that your commit will cause conflicts with code written by your collaborators.

```{task}
1. Perform two separate set of changes to the file `hello.txt` (i.e. add some text). 
2. Commit the changes (make sure to include *sensible* commit messages). 
3. View the history of your repository by using the `$ git log` command.

```

### Ignoring files/folders

A typical statistical analysis folder will contain several files that we do not want to version control. Remember, that version control systems are designed to track changes done to simple text files that are bound to change over time (i.e. mostly source code), or are required for the work (e.g. data sets). 

Moreover, we do not want to version control the *output* from our scripts / analysis workflow. *Generated* output should be treated as "disposable". After all, the point of reproducible research is that we should be able to *generate* any output by running our reproducible script (i.e. data + source code = output). So we do not want to version control *any* file / folder which can be generated / reproduced from code.

```{info, title = "Warning", collapsible = FALSE}
Another really important thing to bear in mind is if you have any files that contain **sensitive information** (for example, you might have **confidential** data that shouldn't be shared). If you are only keeping a **local** Git repo (i.e. on your own machine), then you could include these, but be aware that pushing to an **online repository** (more on this later) will upload all files that are tracked (or have been tracked) in the repo. Hence if you have sensitive information, it is sensible to **not track** these files.
```

In order to tell Git to completely ignore a subset of files / folders, we need to place a simple text file called [`.gitignore`](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) in our repository (you can create this file "manually" or via the command `$ touch .gitignore`). We populate this file with a list of files / folders that we want Git to ignore. For example:

```
output/              # ignore folder called "output"
*.pdf                # ignore all PDF files
*.csv                # ignore all csv files
Info.docx            # ignore the Word document "Info.docx"
sens_info/*.docx     # ignore all Word documents in 'sens_info' folder
```

There are several options available to specify groups of files / folders via [pattern matching](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). Personally, I tend to structure my analysis folder into distinct directories, those that contain source code and need to be version controlled and everything else (data, images, etc.).

```{task}
1. Create a `sens_info.txt` file within your `first_repo` directory.
3. Run the `$ git status` command and examine its output.
4. Create a `.gitignore` file and specify that `sens_info.txt` should be ignored by Git.
5. Re-run the `$ git status` command and re-examine its output. 
6. Commit the `.gitignore` file. 

```

### Viewing previous versions

One of the key features of using a version control system is that you can view any previous version. We can view the history of our repository through the following command:

```
$ git log
```

For example:

```
commit 93f53cf6b38dbb46b6016fc3d10b1acb8b5aa57d (HEAD -> main)
Author: TJ McKinley <t.mckinley@exeter.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Nov 11 10:47:23 2021 +0000

    Added .gitignore file.

commit 6b16fbf14f554dab17f18ac2b62239ed9eb27563
Author: TJ McKinley <t.mckinley@exeter.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Nov 11 10:30:34 2021 +0000

    Added reply.

commit 0c07add055d94161a2ac8a749886568aa437811a
Author: TJ McKinley <t.mckinley@exeter.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Nov 11 10:29:50 2021 +0000

    Added question.

commit b3915e3b823877c4d72d200cc65d9c7e3ab500c7
Author: TJ McKinley <t.mckinley@exeter.ac.uk>
Date:   Thu Nov 11 09:43:52 2021 +0000

    First draft of hello.txt.
```

The long string of letters and numbers next to each commit (e.g. `commit 93f53cf6b38dbb46b6016fc3d10b1acb8b5aa57d`) are called "hashes" (specifically an [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) hash). Think of them as "version 1", "version 2", etc.---they each provide a **unique snapshot** of your repo.

To view previous versions of our repository we use the `checkout` command and the corresponding commit hash. For example:

```
$ git checkout 0c07add05
```

```{info, title = "Warning", collapsible = FALSE}
Make sure you have committed any changes in your current repo before switching to an older version! Git is clever enough that if it detects any uncommitted work, it won't let you check out. You will see the following error:

``
error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
	hello.txt
Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
Aborting
``

```

Typically you only need the first 6--7 digits of the hash to point to a commit unambiguously (see [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Revision-Selection) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18134627/how-much-of-a-git-sha-is-generally-considered-necessary-to-uniquely-identify-a) for more details).

When you are finished viewing an older version of the repo you can go back to your current ("main") repo as follows:

```
$ git checkout main
```

Note that you can also view specific files from a commit (rather than all of them), by including the file name:

```
$ git checkout 0c07add05 hello.txt 
```

This is particularly useful if you want to *revert* a specific file to the version stored in a previous commit (you'll just need to follow the usual commit procedure).

### Viewing differences across versions

The `diff` command lets us view the *differences* across different versions of our repo. The default command:

```
$ git diff
```

Will show us *all* the differences between the current state of our working directory and the last commit.

We can view *all* the differences across specific commits by using the appropriate hashes. For example:

```
$ git diff b3915e3b 0c07add05
```

Instead of viewing all the differences, we can focus on differences across specific files. For example:

```
git diff 86297ac 68a4dfd hello.txt
```

```{task}
1. Display the history log of your repository. 
2. Choose a few commits and use the `diff` command to explore *all* the changes across different versions. 
3. Now be specific and examine *only* changes pertaining to a particular file (e.g. `hello.txt` or `.gitignore`).

```

### Branching

[Branching](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell) is one of Git's greatest features. So far, our history has been *linear*; we modify our source code and commit the changes. This is OK for some (small) projects, but in practice, science progresses in a fairly non-linear fashion! That is, we tend to try several different methodologies which may or may not work. Instead of having a linear history "littered" with commits of things that didn't quite work (e.g. "Crazy idea 1"), then having to revert back to an older commit, we can use **branches**. 

A Git [`branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) is an independent line of development that isolates your "Crazy idea 1" from your main branch. If your idea didn't work, then you simply delete that branch. If it did work you can [`merge`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) it back with your main branch.

Branching is particularly useful in a collaborative environment. For example, suppose that a consortium, has a [Bayesian statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics) and a [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) expert. Both experts can create their own branch and work independently on their respective models. However, both are sharing the *same* starting point (i.e. the main branch which
up to that point will probably include the data wrangling and visualisation part of the project). Their final work can then be merged into the main branch after careful discussion with the rest of the consortium.

The [`branch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch) command is used to create a new branch:

```
$ git branch crazy_idea
```

Where `crazy_idea` is the name of the branch. To switch to this branch we need to use the `checkout` command:

```
$ git checkout crazy_idea
```

Once you switch to a branch, you can modify-add-commit as per usual.

If your `crazy_idea` was unsuccessful, you can delete the branch as follows (make sure you switch back to the main before trying to delete it):

```
$ git branch -D crazy_idea
```

If you forgot which branch you are working on or how many branches you have, simply type:

```
$ git branch
```

to list all the branches that have been created in your repo.

### Summary of key commands

```
$ git init        # create an empty Git repository
$ git status      # view the current state of the repository
$ git add         # add files to the staging area (prepare for commit)
$ git commit      # record changes to the repository
$ git log         # show the commit history
$ git checkout    # switch to a specific commit or branch
$ git diff        # view changes across different commits
$ git branch      # create / delete branch
```

## GitHub

So far we've only dealt with *local* repositories; normal folders on our computer that contain the hidden `.git` directory (which includes all of our project history). This is fine when working on personal projects on one machine. But what if 
we had access to multiple computers (e.g. a desktop machine and a laptop), or if we're collaborating with other people.

Although Git allows us to move repositories across different machines (as all the project history information is contained within the `.git` folder), we need to manually ensure that these files are properly synced (e.g. if you committed some changes on your laptop, you need to copy the repo back to your desktop machine if you want to see the changes there).

This is of course a time-consuming strategy and prone to frustrating mistakes. Instead, best is to keep a main copy on a central hub on the web, which everyone works on and sync to. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a popular website that provides hosting for software projects and version control using Git ([Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) offer similar services). Think of [GitHub](https://github.com/) as [Google Drive](https://www.google.co.uk/drive/) or [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) for software projects.

In a nutshell, [GitHub](https://github.com/) hosts our **main** copy of the repository *online*. We can then either [`push`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push) changes done locally onto this online version or [`pull`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) (download) the online repository and merge it with our local version. Any collaborator who have access to the same repository can do the same.

Before we start you need to create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/). As this is a tool that you will probably use after leaving the University, I would use a personal email address. 

### Creating and syncing a GitHub repository {#create-Github-repo}

Once you're logged into your GitHub account, click on the "+" icon in the top right corner to create a new repository:

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Creating a new repository on GitHub.", out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/github-new-repo.png")
```

For the purpose of this demo, we can choose the "Public" repo option (if you're working on a confidential project than simply choose the "Private" option). Leave all the "initialisation" options unchecked, as we will be connecting our local repository to this one.

> **Note**: Your online and local repositories can have different names, however, it's good practice to use
the same name to avoid confusion.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Configuring the details of a new repository on GitHub.", out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/github-config-repo.png")
```

This step essentially creates a folder called `first_repo` on GitHub's servers, followed by running the command `$ git init`. As soon as the GitHub repository is created, we are prompted with information on how to add files to this online repository. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Adding files to our newly created GitHub repository.", out.width = "99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/github-push-repo.png")
```

The key piece of information is the URL `https://github.com/jjvalletta/first_repo.git`. This specifies the web address of our online repository. 

As we already got a local repository, we need to follow the instructions under **push an existing repository from the command line**. Let's go through these commands one by one (make sure you copy your own URL when doing this!).

```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jjvalletta/first_repo.git
```

The `remote` command helps us managing online (remote) repositories. In this case we are labelling the URL that points to our online repo as `origin`. The name `origin` is just a convention, but it's such a universal default that you should stick with it, unless you have strong reasons not to. To make sure things have been set correctly, run the following command:

```
$ git remote -v
```

The next command is:

```
$ git branch -M main
```

You do **not** need to run this command if you are already on the main branch. As far as I can tell this is more of a convention, to make sure that your main branch is called `main`. That is, if your project only contained one branch and it was called something else other than `main`, this command will rename it to `main` (however, if you really wanted to name your "main" branch something else, you can in that case for the next command, replace "main" with the name of your only branch).

Finally:

```
$ git push -u origin main
```

The `push` command uploads the changes from our local repository to the online GitHub repository.

If successful we can now navigate to the main page of the repository and click on "commits" to see the commit history.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Viewing the commit history on GitHub.", out.width = "99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/github-commit-history.png")
```

The GitHub repository now contains the same information stored on our local machine. Note that the string of numbers and letters on the right hand side of each commit is the unique commit hash, described earlier. If you click on the hash key, GitHub's diff tool will appear so you can visually assess the changes done in that commit (for more details see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/comparing-commits#comparing-branches)).

From now on, every time we want to sync our local repo with the online repo, we re-run:

```
$ git push -u origin main
```

I recommend syncing the repos (i.e. run the command above), every time you commit a change, so that you don't forget, and such that your online repo is always mirroring your local one.

Here, we only synced up our main branch, but what about our `crazy_idea` branch? Simple: 

```
$ git push -u origin crazy_idea
```

> **Note**: The `-u` option is synonymous with the `--set-upstream-to` option used to associate the current branch with a remote branch so that the `git pull` (see later on) command can be used without any arguments. 

```{task}
1. Follow the steps in this section to create a GitHub repo called `first_repo` and sync it
with your local repo. 
2. Commit a few separate changes to the main and `crazy_idea` branch.
3. Push these changes to the GitHub repo. 
4. View the commit history on GitHub and use its diff tool to visually compare changes across commits.

```

### Syncing remote repo to local repo

Suppose your colleague has pushed some changes to the GitHub repo, or you have pushed some changes from your laptop, but you are now working from your desktop machine, and you would like to continue working on the most up-to-date repo. The [`pull`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) command lets you download these changes and merges them with your local repo:

```
$ git pull origin main
```

You can also `pull` specific branches by replacing "main" with the name of the branch.

> **Note**: The [`pull`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-pull) command actually calls the [`fetch`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fetch) command first (which downloads the updated objects from the remote repo), followed by the [`merge`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) command, which joins / merges the local repo with the remote one. Conflicts might arise if Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits (more info [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)).

### Cloning a remote repo

Suppose a colleague has already created a repo that they want you to collaborate on, or you just found an interesting public repo that you want to download and play around with its code. The [`clone`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) command can be used to create an exact copy of the online repo on your computer. The only thing we need to know is the URL of where the repo is located.

For example, imagine we want to trawl through the code of the popular R package [`tidyr`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/). We navigate to its GitHub [page](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr), then click on the green button called "Code" and copy the URL.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Accessing the GitHub URL for the `tidyr` repo.", out.width = "99%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/github-tidyr.png")
```

Then run the following command (make sure you are in the directory where you actually want to download this repo to):

```
$ git clone https://github.com/tidyverse/tidyr.git
```

## Git in RStudio

So far we have been typing our Git actions on the command line, either using the **Terminal** (Mac / Linux users) or **Git Bash** (Windows users). RStudio has a built-in connection to the command line (tab next to "Console"---see Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-terminal)). So when we are writing code in RStudio, we do not need to open a separate command line window, we can do everything from within the RStudio IDE. 

```{r rstudio-terminal, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The terminal window in RStudio.", out.width = "60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/rstudio-terminal.png")
```

However, more importantly, as Git is such a ubiquitous tool for software development, RStudio offers built-in support. Which means that you can execute routine Git commands from within RStudio without having to use the command-line.

**So why on earth are you telling us this now?!**

a. Wanted to hammer home the point that [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a standalone piece of software, and is completely unrelated to R / RStudio. Git can be used to version control *any* type of text file, not just R. 

b. It is important to gain some familiarity with the command-line, as it is likely that you will have to use it at some point in your statistics / data science career.

c. RStudio's built-in Git support, although enough for most use cases, it does not cover *all* of the Git commands. So there will still be times where you have to directly interact with the command line. 

d. RStudio is still merely sending your specified Git actions to the command line, i.e. if you click on "Commit", it's writing `$ git commit` on the command line. So familiarity with the Git commands is useful.

> **Note**: RStudio is not the only Git GUI client. There are several other general purpose Git [clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) (i.e. not limited to RStudio projects), such as [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). 

### Creating a local Git repository {#rstudio-local-git}

*File > New Project > New Directory > New Project*, and check the *Create a git repository* option (see Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-new-git)). 

```{r rstudio-new-git, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Creating a local Git repository in RStudio.", out.width = "65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/rstudio-new-git.png")
```

Now we get access to a menu with routine Git commands (encircled in red in Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-git-opt)). The project was also initialised with a `.gitignore` file, which already contains a list of RStudio specific hidden files that we do not want to track (encircled in green in Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-git-opt)). 

```{r rstudio-git-opt, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Git options within RStudio.", out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/rstudio-git-opt.png")
```

The Git options *pane* on the right-hand side of Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-git-opt), shows the *status* of our Git repo (i.e. `$ git status`). By checking the tick box next to `.gitignore` we can *stage* that file, ready to commit it (i.e. `$ git add .gitignore`). After clicking on the "Commit" button we see the following window:

```{r rstudio-git-commit, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Committing changes on RStudio.", out.width = "95%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/rstudio-git-commit.png")
```

Here we can review our changes and view the commit history. Remember to enter a sensible commit message before pressing "Commit" (i.e. `$ git commit -m "First commit of .gitignore."`). You will see the command line popping-up in the background.

The Git status pane (shown in detail in Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-git-status)), uses differently coloured icons to represent the current status of files in our repo (although RStudio refreshes this pane automatically, it's best to manually hit the *refresh* button, found on the far right-hand corner of the pane, before doing anything):

* Yellow (?): A **new** untracked file added to the repo (what should we do with it?). 
* Green (A): **Add** untracked file to the next commit (i.e. start tracking the file).
* Blue (M): A tracked file was **modified**.
* Red (D): A tracked file was **deleted**.

```{r rstudio-git-status, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "The Git status pane in RStudio.", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/rstudio-git-status.png")
```

> **Note**: The `.Rproj` file is used by RStudio to store information about the project (open it in a text editor to see its contents). It is therefore, generally recommended to track this file (see [here](https://community.rstudio.com/t/should-rproj-files-be-added-to-gitignore/1269)).

```{task}
Perform all of the following tasks using the Git functionality within RStudio.
 
1. Create a local Git repository.
2. Commit the default `.gitignore` file and the `.Rproj` file. 
3. Create and compile an R Markdown document to HMTL and / or PDF (either using RStudio's template or copy one from a previous project).
4. Make the relevant changes to `.gitignore` to ignore *any* HTML or PDF files. 
5. Perform a few changes to this file (adding / removing plots, purposefully breaking the code, etc.) and commit those changes separately.
6. View the history log.
7. Use the "Diff" option to visualise changes across commits. 
8. Familiarise yourself with the process of reverting back to specific commits (revert---commit---revert). 

```

### Connecting a local Git repo to GitHub

In Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-git-commit), the "Pull"/ "Push" icons (right-hand corner) are greyed out, i.e. these options are not available. This is because we have not linked our local repo to a remote one. To do this we have to follow the steps outlined in Section \@ref(create-Github-repo) (i.e. unfortunately, there's no point-and-click way to do it in RStudio). In summary:

1. Log in and create a new repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Follow the **push an existing repository from the command line** instructions
(you can use RStudio's built-in connection to the Terminal as shown in Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-terminal)). For example:
```
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/jjvalletta/first_repo.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

You only need to do this first time round. Once the local repo is linked to the remote one, we can use the "Push" / "Pull" functionality from within RStudio (i.e. by clicking on the respective icon).

```{task}
1. Create a new repo on GitHub and link it to the local repo created in Section \@ref(rstudio-local-git).
2. Commit a few changes and use the "Push" option to push them to your remote repo.
3. Navigate to your online repo to confirm that the changes have been pushed correctly.

```

### Cloning a GitHub repo

A more straightforward approach is to create the GitHub (remote) repo *first*, then clone it on your machine via RStudio: 

1. Log in and create a new repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. In RStudio: *File > New Project > Version Control > Git*
3. Copy and paste the remote repo URL from GitHub (e.g. `https://github.com/jjvalletta/demo-repo.git`---see Fig \@ref(fig:rstudio-git-clone)) and voilà!

```{r rstudio-git-clone, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Cloning a GitHub repo using RStudio.", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("git/images/rstudio-git-clone.png")
```

# Visualisation using `ggplot2`

Let's start with a motivating example.

## Gapminder

[Professor Hans Rosling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Rosling) has made a name for himself in the field of data visualisation with his groundbreaking [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) project. 

```{r, screenshot.alt = "images/hans.jpg", echo = F}
include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbkSRLYSojo")
```

For a slightly longer presentation, his TED talk on global development has been watched over 11 million times. If you have 20 minutes, it can be found [here](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?utm_source=tedcomshare&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=tedspread), and is well worth a watch!

> More-or-less as I had finished the first version of these notes, the news broke that Professor Rosling had sadly passed away on 7th February 2017, aged 68. I hope you will find some time to explore the [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) website, and appreciate the immense contribution that he made to the world of public health and education. He presented a world-view based on facts and data. To this end he provided innovative and fascinating ways to explore and understand data, disseminated these findings with pathos and humour, and used this information to challenge many of our pre-conceptions about public health and the developing world. An obituary from the Guardian can be found [here](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/feb/07/hans-rosling-obituary).

The [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) website provides really informative interactive visualisations for many fascinating data sets. In this pracical we will explore how to use R to try to recreate something similar to the types of visualisation that Gapminder provides, and see how high-end R packages---such as `ggplot2`---have been developed that provide a systematic and flexible way to generate complex plots / visualisations. Our aim for this workshop is to emulate the plot in Figure \@ref(fig:gapminder).

```{r, gapminder, fig.cap = "Life expectancy against GDP---screenshot from Gapminder project", echo = F}
include_graphics("images/gapminder.png")
```

Before we do this, let's quickly remind ourselves of basic plotting functionality in R.

## Base R graphics 

Let's begin by exploring the `iris` data set, which gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width, and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are *Iris setosa*, *versicolor*, and *virginica*. This data set is available as part of the base R package. Let's have a look at the data:

```{r}
head(iris)
```

Let's start by visualising the variable `Sepal.Length`using a kernel density plot:.

```{r}
## kernel density of sepal length
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length))
```

> Remember that we can extract a named column from a `data.frame` using the `$` operator. The `density()` function is a simple function in R that takes a `vector` argument and returns a kernel density object, which we can then plot using the generic `plot()` function. 

Now let's try to plot different kernel density plots for the three different species. We could do this as separate plots, and use our standard subsetting notation to extract the correct elements of the data frame in each case:

```{r, fig.show = "hold"}
## plot Sepal.Length for setosa
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "setosa"]))

## plot Sepal.Length for versicolor
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "versicolor"]))

## plot Sepal.Length for virginica
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "virginica"]))
```

What about if we want to add all three density lines to the same plot?

```{r}
## place kernel density estimates on the same plot
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "setosa"]), main = "")
lines(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "versicolor"]))
lines(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "virginica"]))
```

> Notice the use of the `lines()` function to allow a line to be added to an existing plot.

Notice that the limits of the $x$- and $y$-axes in this case are set by the range of the initial `setosa` sepal lengths, and hence the density plots for the other two species extend beyond the plot window. Let's try again, but this time setting the bounds for the plots manually. To do this we calculate the $x$ and $y$ ranges for each density plot separately, and then take the maximum values across the different species. We then use the `xlim` and `ylim` arguments to the `plot()` function in order to set the ranges:

```{r}
## produce densities
setosa_dens <- density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "setosa"])
versicolor_dens <- density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "versicolor"])
virginica_dens <- density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "virginica"])

## extract x-ranges and y-ranges
xlims <- range(c(setosa_dens$x, versicolor_dens$x, virginica_dens$x))
ylims <- range(c(setosa_dens$y, versicolor_dens$y, virginica_dens$y))

## produce plot
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "setosa"]), 
     xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims, main = "")
lines(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "versicolor"]))
lines(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "virginica"]))
```

This is better, but still not very informative. Let's add some colour and a legend, and tidy up the axis labels.

```{r}
## produce plot
plot(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "setosa"]), 
    xlim = xlims, ylim = ylims, main = "", xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)")
lines(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "versicolor"]), col = "red")
lines(density(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "virginica"]), col = "blue")

## add legend to top-right corner
legend(par("usr")[2] * 0.8, par("usr")[4] * 0.95, 
       legend = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"), 
       lty = c(1, 1, 1), 
       col = c("black", "red", "blue"))
```

Notice that this is quite a simple plot, but required a series of steps to render in base R. We needed to calculate manual limits for the axes, plot the three species separately, and then add a custom legend to the plot.

Let's look at another quick example. This time, let's plot sepal length against sepal width for the three species.

```{r}
## produce scatterplot
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, 
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)", ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)")
points(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "versicolor"],
       iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Species == "versicolor"], col = "red")
points(iris$Sepal.Length[iris$Species == "virginica"],
       iris$Sepal.Width[iris$Species == "virginica"], col = "blue")

## add legend
legend(par("usr")[2] * 0.8, par("usr")[4] * 0.98, 
       legend = c("setosa", "versicolor", "virginica"), 
       pch = c(1, 1, 1), 
       col = c("black", "red", "blue"))
```

> Notice the use of the `points()` function to add points to an existing plot. We could set the position of the legend manually, but the objects `par("usr")` provides the coordinates of the plot region in the form `c(x1, x2, y1, y2)`, where `x1` is the lower bound for the $x$-axis, and `x2` is the upper bound for the $x$-axis, and similarly for `y1` and `y2`.

## Introduction to `ggplot2`

We have seen that the R base graphics system is highly flexible, and it can be used to produce high-quality, bespoke visualisations. However, doing so can be a lot of work! Let's show an alternative way to produce similar plots using the `ggplot2` package. We will introduce the code first, and then talk through it.

First we load the `tidyverse` (of which `ggplot2` is included).

```{r, message = F, cache = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

Now run

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species))
```

Notice that we had to do little physical manipulation of the plot. We didn’t have to choose how to position legends, or manually subset the data to plot the different points, or choose the colours; the package took care of all of these things.

So, how does it work? `ggplot2` is based on a book called the [Grammar of Graphics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Grammar-Graphics-Statistics-Computing/dp/0387245448) by [Leland Wilkinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leland_Wilkinson)---hence the name `gg`-`plot`! The ethos of `ggplot2` is that plots can be broken down into different **features**, most notably:

* **data**;
* **aesthetic mapping**;
* **geometric object**;
* **scales**;
* **faceting**;
* statistical transformations;
* coordinate system;
* position adjustments.

Perhaps the easiest way to explain some of these concepts is to work through our examples step-by-step. We will focus on the main components marked in **bold** above. Let's start with the scatterplot example first, and examine the first part of the code:

```{r}
ggplot(iris)
```

This sets up the plot. The first argument to the `ggplot` function is the **data**, which here is the `iris` data set.

> **Important**: whereas base R graphics can plot various object types, `ggplot()` **requires** `data.frame` (or `tibble`[^1]) objects. It is designed for plotting statistical data sets. Never fear, most R objects can be manipulated into `data.frames` for plotting if required. (See next session on **data wrangling**.)

[^1]: We will see `tibble` objects later on---just think of them as special `data.frames`.

### Aesthetics

The `aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)` part sets the **aesthetics**, which here are added as an argument to the `geom_point()` function (see nect section). These define how the data are **mapped** onto the visual aesthetics of the plot. Here we are setting the `x` coordinates to be `Sepal.Length`, the `y` coordinates to be `Sepal.Width`, and the `colour` of the characters to be related to `Species`. In general, **aesthetics** include:

* position;
* colour (border or line color);
* fill (inside color);
* shape;
* linetype;
* size.

> As usual, information can be found in the relevant help files, but a really useful resource for `ggplot2` is the [Data Visualisation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf). Another fantastic resource, is the [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/) by Winston Chang, which has a free online version, or a physical book that you can buy.

> **Notice** that we did not have to use the `$` operator to extract columns. This makes `ggplot2` code a lot clearer. R knows to look for the `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` columns in the `iris` data, because we have told `ggplot()` which data set to operate on.

<!-- Notice that only an **empty plot** has been drawn so far, there are no points present. This is because we haven't told `ggplot2` what type of plot we want. We do this by specifying a **geom**.  -->

### Geoms

A **geom** defines the type of plot we want. In this case we want a **scatterplot**, which can be defined by the `geom_point()` function. Geoms can be layered, allowing us to built complex plots in different ways. Common geoms are:

* `geom_point()`
* `geom_line()`
* `geom_histogram()`
* `geom_density()`
* `geom_bar()`
* `geom_violin()`

Please see the [Data Visualisation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) for more examples.

**Note**: `ggplot2` **builds** plots up by *adding* together components. There are lots of ways to do this. Here I have set up "global" options for the plot (including the aesthetics) using the `ggplot()` function. I then **add** (`+`) to this the type of plot I want i.e. `+ geom_point()`. The addition sign is important. If I want to split the function over multiple lines, make sure the `+` sign is at the **end** of each line, so R knows that the plot is not complete at the point.

Let's see how this works:

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species))
```

Nice! With one tiny function we have added colours *and* legends. All nicely formatted to work together in one plot!

> **Important**: Each type of `geom` accepts only a subset of all aesthetics. Information on these can be found in the help files for each `geom_*` type, or see also the [Data Visualisation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf). Most of these are fairly obvious. For example, a scatterplot requires both `x` and `y` aesthetics as a minimum. A kernel density geom e.g. `geom_density()`, requires only an `x` aesthetic (we will come back to this shortly). Some aesthetics do not make sense for certain types of geom; for example, it makes sense that a `shape` aesthetic can be added to `geom_point()` but not to `geom_line()`. Conversely, adding a `linetype` aesthetic to `geom_line()` makes sense, but not to `geom_point()`. 

### Labels and titles

Labels and titles can be added fairly easily, using the `xlab()`, `ylab()` and `ggtitle()` functions:

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) + 
    xlab("Sepal Length (cm)") + ylab("Sepal Width (cm)") +
    ggtitle("Scatterplot of sepal lengths and widths")
```

```{task}
Let's return to the density plot example. Produce a plot containing three density plots for `Sepal.Length`, stratified by `Species`. **Hint**: use the `geom_density()` geom, which requires an `x` aesthetic only.
```

```{solution}

``{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Length, colour = Species))
``

```

```{task}
Produce the same density plot, but replace the `colour` aesthetic with a `fill` aesthetic. What happens?
```

```{solution}

``{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species))
``

We can see that now we have produced filled density plots. However, since these overlap each other, it is difficult to see the full shapes of these distributions.
```

```{task}
Now add an `alpha` channel to this plot. An `alpha` channel controls the degree of opacity for the colours, where `alpha = 0` corresponds to complete transparency, and `alpha = 1` to complete opacity. Note that we **do not** want to map the `alpha` channel to an aesthetic here, rather we want all fill colours to be, say 50% transparent. We can therefore add an `alpha = 0.5` argument to the `geom_density()` function. What happens?
```

```{solution}

``{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species), alpha = 0.5)
``

Now we can better see the shapes of these distributions.
```

```{task}
Tidy up the labels and add a plot title to produce a final plot.
```

```{solution}

``{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species), alpha = 0.5) + 
    xlab("Sepal Length (cm)") + ylab("Density") + 
    ggtitle("Density plots of sepal length by species")
``

```

### **Aside**: aesthetics vs. generic options

As a quick aside, notice that when we set the `alpha` channel above, we did not set it as an aesthetic, rather we set it as a generic option which was applied to all components of the plot. Perhaps the easiest way to visualise this difference, is to consider different `colour` options. Take a look at these next pieces of code and try to understand the differences between them.

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species))
```

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), colour = "red")
```

```{task}
What happens if you try to run the following code?
    
``{r, eval= F}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), colour = Species)
``

Why does this happen?
```

```{solution}
In this case you get an error:
    
``{r, error = T}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), colour = Species)
``

This is because you are trying to set a generic `colour` using a vector object `Species`. Since the `colour` option is not part of the aesthetics, `ggplot()` does not know where to find `Species`. 
```

### Faceting

Another really useful feature of `ggplot` is the ability to use faceting to display sub-plots according to some grouping variable. For example, let's assume that we want to produce separate plots of sepal length vs. width for each of the three species of iris. We can do this using faceting:

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
    facet_wrap(~ Species)
```
Neat eh? Note that we can also use different aesthetics within the facets. For example, we could also add a `colour` aesthetic e.g.

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, colour = Species)) +
    facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

This doesn't add anything more to the plot here since the colours are redundant. Later we will see a better example of this.

> **Note** there is also a `facet_grid()` option that allows us to facet by more than one variable. Please see the [Data Visualisation Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf) for more details.

### Statistical transformations

Another feature of `ggplot2` is that we can layer transformations over the top of our raw data. For example, there is a `stat_smooth()` function that allows us to overlay a smoothed non-parametric line to a scatterplot. For example:

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
    stat_smooth(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width))
```
Notice that this has added a `loess` smoothed line to the plot[^loess]. We could instead add a linear line if we prefer, by setting a `method` argument to `stat_smooth` e.g.

[^loess]: just think of this as a smoothed line-of-best-fit through the data for the time being

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
    stat_smooth(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), method = "lm")
```

With the addition of a single function we can now add different lines for each species:

```{r}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
    stat_smooth(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), method = "lm") +
    facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

> **Aside**: this is a neat example of [Simpson's Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox), which an apparent trend in the data disappears or reverses when the trend is explored in subsets of the data. (In this case the linear model suggested a negative correlation between sepal length and width when the species information was ignored, but a positive correlation within each species.)

### **Aside**: "global" vs. "local" options

Notice that in the code below the `geom_point()` and `stat_smooth()` functions use the same aesthetics. In this case it is possible to add "global" aesthetics to a plot through the `ggplot2()` function, which can then be accessed by sub-functions. Hence the following two pieces of code are equivalent here.

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(iris) +
    geom_point(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
    stat_smooth(aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width), method = "lm") +
    facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width)) +
    geom_point() +
    stat_smooth(method = "lm") +
    facet_wrap(~ Species)
```

Mixtures of "global" and "local" aesthetics can be used where necessary, which is particularly useful when layering information from different data sets onto the same plot.

### Scales

Scales control the details of how data values are translated to visual properties. These allow us to control translations from data to aesthetics. We will see some simple examples of these in due course.

## A more complex example: Gapminder

Let's take these ideas and return to our Gapminder data. Datasets from the Gapminder project can be downloaded from [https://www.gapminder.org/data](https://www.gapminder.org/data). However, the particular data set required to replicate Figure \@ref(fig:gapminder) is available in a package in R called (naturally) [`gapminder`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/index.html). If not already installed, then this can be installed in the usual way e.g.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages("gapminder")
```

Once you have it installed we need to load the packages. 

```{r, cache = F, message = F}
library(gapminder)
```

To have a quick look at the data, which are available as an object called `gapminder`.

```{r}
gapminder
```

Here we can see that the data set consists of `r nrow(gapminder)` rows and `r ncol(gapminder)` columns, and contains information on country, continent, life expectancy, population size, GDP (per capita) and year.

> The R aficionados amongst you might notice the slightly strange `print` behaviour of the `gapminder` object. If we try to `print` a `data.frame` object to the screen, then it usually prints the whole object. Here it's printed an attenuated version of the object. This is because the `gapminder` data set is saved as a `tibble` object, rather than a standard `data.frame`. 

> **Aside**: A `tibble` is an enhanced `data.frame` object which are generally easier to examine. For example, they force R to display only the data that fits onscreen. It also adds some information about the class of each column. In fact, the `tibble` package---loaded as part of the `tidyverse`---introduces the `as_tibble()` function to convert ordinary `data.frame` objects to `tibble` objects, in case you want to use this functionality in future. Please see the [Data Import Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-import.pdf) for more information.
>  
>  Note also that `tibble` objects seem to make a distinction between integers (`<int>`) and doubles (`<dbl>`), instead of just using `numeric`. R makes no such distinction in practice, and so you can think of either of these as simply `numeric` types.
> 
> We'll use `tibbles` more generally in the later data wrangling session.

Let's just clarify the data:

* **`country`**: country of interest (`factor`);
* **`continent`**: continent country can be found in (`factor`);
* **`year`**: year corresponding to data (in increments of 5 years) (`numeric`);
* **`lifeExp`**: life expectancy at birth (in years) (`numeric`);
* **`pop`**: population size (`numeric`);
* **`gdpPercap`**: GDP per capita, in dollars, by Purchasing Power Parities and adjusted for inflation (`numeric`).

### GDP against life expectancy

Let's think about Figure \@ref(fig:gapminder) and try to map the various aesthetics in the plot to our data set. We have:

Table: (\#tab:gapaes) Aesthetics for gapminder plot

Aesthetic | Variable
:-------: | :--------:
`x`       |  `gdpPercap`
`y`       |  `lifeExp`
`colour`  |  `continent`
`size`    |  `pop` 

```{task}
Using `ggplot2`, produce a scatterplot that uses the aesthetics in Table \@ref(tab:gapaes) for just the year 1952.
```

```{solution}

``{r}
ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$year == 1952, ], 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
    geom_point() 
``

```

Notice how rich this plot is already. One thing to note is that in Figure \@ref(fig:gapminder) the $x$-axis is plotted on the $\log_{10}$ scale. There are two ways in which we can handle this: either by transforming the `gdpPercap` variable directly, or by using an appropriate `scales_*` function. Here we want to apply a $\log_{10}$ transformation to the `x` aesthetic.

```{task}

1. Redo the previous plot but with the aesthetic `x = log10(gdpPercap)`. 
2. Redo the previous plot with the aesthetic `x = gdpPercap` but with an additional `scale_x_log10()` layer.

How do these plots differ?
```

```{solution}

``{r}
ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$year == 1952, ], 
       aes(x = log10(gdpPercap), y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
    geom_point() 
``

``{r}
ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$year == 1952, ], 
       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
    geom_point() + scale_x_log10()
``

The plots differ purely in the labels for the $x$-axis.
```

> **Important**: `ggplot2` also allows you to save the plot as an object, which can be updated at a later date or used within other functions. For example,
> ```{r}
p <- ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$year == 1952, ], 
>       aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = continent)) +
>    geom_point()
> ```
> creates an object called `p` that contains the plot information. This will not be plotted until the objected is **printed** to the screen e.g.
> ```{r, message = F}
> p
> ```
> **Note**: If using `ggplot` inside functions you may have to explicitly use the `print()` function (e.g. `print(p)`).
> 
> This can be useful if we want to add things to an existing plot at a later stage without having to rewrite the entire plot. For example, to set the scales on plot `p` we can do:
> ```{r, message = F}
> p <- p + scale_x_log10()
> p
> ```

`ggplot2` has lots of built in transformations e.g. `"log"`, `"exp"`, `"sqrt"`, `"log10"` and so on. Or you can define your own. Notice that we have not transformed the data, we have merely told `ggplot()` on what scale to plot it. This sorts out the axis tick labelling automatically. 

We can also scale other aesthetics. For example, although the relative areas of the points are scaled nicely, we probably want the largest points to be slightly larger. Hence we can scale the area of the maximum point by using the `scale_size_area()` function: 

```{r}
p <- p + scale_size_area(max_size = 10)
p
```

Again, labels and titles can be added fairly easily, using the `xlab()`, `ylab()` and `ggtitle()` functions:

```{r}
p <- p + xlab("log10(GDP per capita)") +
    ylab("Life expectancy at birth (years)") +
    ggtitle("1952")
p
```

Changing the legend titles is a bit less intuitive unfortunately, but can be done using the `guides()` options (I had to Google this one). (Notice that the legends map to the aesthetics, so there is a `colour` legend that maps to the colour aesthetic, and a `size` legend that maps to the size aesthetic.)

```{r}
p <- p + guides(colour = guide_legend(title = "Continent")) +
    guides(size = guide_legend(title = "Population size"))
p
```

Not bad. Finally notice that by default `ggplot2` uses a light-grey background. This seems to prove somewhat divisive. There is a solid theory behind choosing this as the default, since it provides clarity without having too much contrast. However, some people don't like it, and so there are options to turn this off (using `theme()`). In this case we can simply turn this off using `theme_bw()` (a black-and-white theme).

```{r}
p <- p + theme_bw()

There are many, many possible options with `ggplot2`. Far too many to cover here. We can only really get a flavour of what can be achieved. I have often found Google to be invaluable for learning `ggplot2`. Let's have a look at a couple of other examples.

### GDP per continent

Another chart seen in Professor Rosling's TED talk was a stacked density plot. This is a smoothed version of a **histogram**. Let's start by looking at the distribution of GPD values across all countries in 1952. This can be done with the `geom_density()` geom as in the earlier example, which requires only an `x` aesthetic---see `?geom_density`---since it calculates the density on the $y$-axis automatically from the data once we have chosen an appropriate bandwidth.

```{r, message = F}
ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$year == 1952, ],
       aes(x = gdpPercap)) +
    geom_density() +
    scale_x_log10()
```

This simple plot is producing a density plot of the distribution of GDP across **all countries** in 1952. How do split this by continent? Well, there are various ways. One way would be to set the `fill` aesthetic to map to the `continent` variable:

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder[gapminder$year == 1952, ],
       aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
    geom_density() +
    scale_x_log10()
```

This produces an **overlapped** density plot by default. The patterns are quite difficult to see here, due to the `Oceania` data, so for the purposes of exposition only we're going to remove `Oceania` from the subsequent plots. This is an informative plot. We can see that African countries tend to have lower GDP per capita than the Americas for example; with Asia and Africa the poorest continents in the 1950s in terms of GDP. 

> **Aside**: what does the `Oceania` density plot tell us about the range of GDPs in the Oceania continent?

#### Positions

Professor Rosling uses a **stacked** density plot, rather than overlapping density plots. We can use a `position = "stack"` argument to the geom to force the stacking. 

```{r}
## remove Oceania (for exposition purposes only)
gapminderNoOc <- gapminder[gapminder$continent != "Oceania", ]

## produce stacked density plot
ggplot(gapminderNoOc[gapminderNoOc$year == 1952, ],
       aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
    geom_density(position = "stack") +
    scale_x_log10() 
```

Histograms and barplots have equivalent `position = "dodge"` and `position = "stack"` commands. By default histograms use the latter. The former is not very useful for histograms, but very useful for barplots with multiple discrete groupings.

```{task}
Try tidying up the axis and legend titles on these plots.
```

```{solution}

``{r}
ggplot(gapminderNoOc[gapminderNoOc$year == 1952, ],
       aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
    geom_density(position = "stack") +
    scale_x_log10() +
    xlab("log10(GDP per capita)") + 
    ylab("Count") +
    ggtitle("1952") +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Continent")) 
``
    
```

```{task}
Write a function in R that takes a `data` and a `year` argument and plots a stacked density plot for a given year. Use this to plot the data for 1952, 1982, 1992 and 2002. (Remember that if you want to plot a `ggplot2` figure from inside a function, you will have to call `print()` explicitly.)
```

```{solution}

``{r}
plotGapminder_gg <- function(data, year = 1952) {
    p <- ggplot(data[data$year == year, ],
       aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
    geom_density(position = "stack") +
    scale_x_log10() +
    xlab("log10(GDP per capita)") + 
    ylab("Count") +
    ggtitle(year) +
    guides(fill = guide_legend(title = "Continent"))
    print(p)
}
for(i in c(1952, 1982, 1992, 2002)) {
    plotGapminder_gg(gapminderNoOc, i)
}
``

```

```{task}
Produce a density plot of `log10(gdpPercap)` faceted by `continent`, for the year 1952.
```

```{solution}

``{r, message = F}
ggplot(gapminderNoOc[gapminderNoOc$year == 1952, ],
       aes(x = gdpPercap)) +
    geom_density()  +
    scale_x_log10()  +
    facet_wrap(~ continent)
``

```

```{task}
Now generate a series of stacked density plots, with colours corresponding to different continents, but faceted by different years, to see how the relative distributions change over time.
```

```{solution}

``{r, message = F}
ggplot(gapminderNoOc,
       aes(x = gdpPercap, fill = continent)) +
    geom_density(position = "stack") +
    scale_x_log10() +
    facet_wrap(~ year)
``

```

## Additional task

A cost of increased reproduction in terms of reduced longevity has been shown for female fruitflies, but not for males. We have data from an experiment that used a factorial design to assess whether increased sexual activity affected the lifespan of male fruitflies.

The flies used were an outbred stock. Sexual activity was manipulated by supplying individual males with one or eight receptive virgin females per day. The longevity of these males was compared with that of two control types. The first control consisted of two sets of individual males kept with one or eight newly inseminated females. Newly inseminated females will not usually remate for at least two days, and thus served as a control for any effect of competition with the male for food or space. The second control was a set of individual males kept with no females. There were 25 males in each of the five groups, which were treated identically in number of anaesthetizations (using $\mathrm{CO}_2$) and provision of fresh food medium.

The data should have the following columns:

* **id**: a ID for each fly in each group (1--25).
* **partners**: number of companions (0, 1 or 8).
* **type**: type of companion (inseminated female; virgin female; not applicable (when 'partners = 0')).
* **longevity**: lifespan, in days.
* **thorax**: length of thorax, in mm.

```{task}
The file "ff.rds" contains the data from this experiment. Download this data set to your working directory, read it into R using the command:
    
``{r, eval = F}
ff <- readRDS("ff.rds")
``

and use `ggplot2` to reproduce something similar to the plot below:
     
![Plot of fruitfly data stratified by experimental group](images/fruitflies.png).
```

```{solution}

``{r, echo = F}
ff <- readRDS("uploadFiles/ff.rds")
``

``{r, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 8}
## produce summary plot
ggplot(ff, aes(y = longevity, x = thorax, 
               linetype = type, shape = type)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F) +
    facet_wrap(~ partners) +
    guides(linetype = guide_legend(title = "Partner Type")) +
    guides(shape = guide_legend(title = "Partner Type")) +
    ylab("Longevity (days)") +
    xlab("Thorax length (mm)")

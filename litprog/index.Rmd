# Introduction {-}

```{r, child = "_setup.Rmd", include = F, purl = F, cache = F}
```

In this practical we will focus on the important concepts of **reproducibility** and **literate programming**. We will assume that you are familiar with R and RStudio.

## Data files {-}

All data and script files files can be downloaded as a ZIP file from [here](https://exeter-data-analytics.github.io/LitProg/dataFiles.zip).

## Tasks {-}

```{task}
All **tasks** will be denoted in panel boxes like this one. In the HTML version, all solutions can be toggled by hitting the **Show Solution** buttons. In the PDF version solutions are given in the Appendix and are linked via the **Show Solution** buttons.
```

```{solution}
The answer is, of course, 42.

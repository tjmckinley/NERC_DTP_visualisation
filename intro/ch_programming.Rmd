The popularity of R is in part due to its fantastic packages and extremely flexible graphical capabilities. It is often easy to forget that it is a fully functional programming language in its own right. In this section we cover how to implement some standard programming practices, such as `for` and `while` loops, conditional `if` statements and so on.

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
As previously stated, R is a **high-level** language, and as such does not require the same level of code complexity to work. For example, it is not necessary to differentiate between `integer`, `float` and `double` types for numerical arrays. It is also not necessary to declare objects in advance of using them---you can create objects 'on-the-fly', and even change an object type without any memory reallocation. In addition, R has many [packages](https://cran.r-project.org/) which provide **functions** to implement a huge number of different algorithms or analyses etc. The cost of this functionality is **speed**. For example, a `for` loop written in native R code will generally be ***much*** slower than an equivalent loop written in e.g. C. For simple problems this difference is often practically negligible, and is often counter-balanced against the fact that R code is usually significantly faster to write. However, for computationally demanding algorithms this difference in execution time can be highly significant. Many R functions circumvent this by virtue of actually being written in C (or Fortran) under-the-hood: simply providing a user-friendly interface to a fast underlying C executable. We have already seen examples of this for vectorised functions such as `mean()` and `sum()`.
```

Often, native R code is very useful to know, and so the following sections introduce some (hopefully) familiar concepts in the context of R.

## Loops

R has implementations of both `for` and `while` loops. For example,

### `for` loops

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) { 
    print(i) 
}
```

This command creates an object `i`, which takes the values in the vector `1:10` in turn, and prints each to the screen. We could write this whole loop on a single line, without the curly brackets `{}` e.g. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for(i in 1:10) print(i)
```

However, the curly brackets delineate the contents of the loop, and are necessary for multi-line statements. Hence I encourage you to use them even for single-line arguments for clarity and consistency.

A more complex example is

```{r}
for(i in 1:10) {
    ## generate 10 random numbers
    ## uniformly between 0 and 1
    x <- runif(10)
    
    ## calculate the mean
    x <- mean(x)
    
    ## print the mean to the screen
    print(x)
}
```

Here I've included comments in the loop itself. Of course it is also possible to use nested functions to write this more concisely.

```{task}
Write the *content* of above `for` loop using nested functions. You should be able to fit the content of the loop on a single line. Why does your code print different values to before?
```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = FALSE}
## the code can be condensed to a single line
## using nested functions. The answers are different
## because each line generates a different set of 
## random numbers - the replicate we would need
## to set the seed
for(i in 1:10) { 
    print(mean(runif(10))) 
}
``

```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
For single line pieces of code, it is not always necessary to use curly brackets `{}` to delineate the loop. However, it is a good habit to get into, and saves lots of simple errors. **Hence, in this module I will insist you always delineate loops and if/else statements using curly brackets.** Please let me know if I've missed any!
```

```{info, title = "Important", collapsible = FALSE}
The use of **indentation** to delineate what is inside of the `for` loop. Unlike say Python, these indentations are not necessary for R to work, but in my opinion greatly help the comprehension of the code. Along with comments and spacing, this is a useful habit to get into, hence why I insist upon it here. For example, something like:
\newline
``
for(i in 1:10) {
x <- runif(10)
print(x)
}
``
is bad programming practice (in my opinion).
```
    
Loops can also be **nested**:

```{r}
for(i in 1:3) {
    for(j in 1:3) { 
        print(c(i, j))
    }
}
```

```{task}
Write a piece of R code, using nested `for` loops, that transposes a 3 $\times$ 3 matrix. Test it on the matrix `x <- matrix(1:9, 3, 3)`
```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = TRUE}
## create x matrix
x <- matrix(1:9, 3, 3)
x

## there are lots of ways to do this
## I have created a dummy matrix, populated it
## and then saved over the original
xt <- matrix(0, 3, 3)
for(i in 1:3) {
    for(j in 1:3) {
        xt[i, j] <- x[j, i]
    }
}
x <- xt
rm(xt)
x
``

```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
`for` loops in R can loop over any type of vector, not just sequential indices. For example, 
``{r}
letters[1:5]
for(i in letters[1:5]) {
    print(i)
}
``
```

### `while` loops

R's `while` statement works in a similar way. The loop continues until some logical statement is met. For example,

```{r}
i <- 1
while(i < 5) {
    print(i)
    i <- i + 1
}
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
R doesn't have a `++` operator like C. In addition notice that the `i` variable had to be initialised in advance of the loop, so that the `while` statement could be evaluated. The `i` variable is then incremented during the loop.
```

```{info, title = "Warning", collapsible = FALSE}
A common coding error is to create **infinite** loops. You must take care to ensure that the loop will eventually end. For example, the following code will produce an infinite loop. Why?
    
``
i <- 1
while(i < 5) { 
    print(i) 
}
``

```

```{task}
Write a `while` loop that generates a uniform random number between 0 and 1 (use the `runif()` function), until a number of > 0.9 is obtained.
```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = FALSE}
## set initial value to arbitrary value to enable
## while loop to initialise
x <- 0
while(x < 0.9) {
    x <- runif(1)
}
x
``

```

## Conditional statements

R also supports conditional statements, such as `if` and `else`. These help the code to change its path depending on whether a condition is true or false. For example:

```{r}
y <- runif(1)
if(y < 0.5) {
    print("y is < 0.5")
} else {
    print("y is >= 0.5")
}
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
That the `else` statement starts on the same line as the closing bracket `}` from the preceding `if` statement.
```

Conditional statements can also be **nested**.

```{task}
Generate two uniform random numbers between 0 and 1, called `x` and `y`. Write a nested `if`/`else` statement that prints out whether `x` is > 0.5, and then whether `y` is > 0.5.
```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = FALSE}
## generate random numbers
x <- runif(1)
y <- runif(1)
x
y
if(x > 0.5) {
    print("x > 0.5")
    if(y < 0.5) {
        print("y < 0.5")
    } else {
        print("y > 0.5")
    }
} else {
    print("x < 0.5")
    if(y < 0.5) {
        print("y < 0.5")
    } else {
        print("y > 0.5")
    }
}
``

```

R also supports an `ifelse` function, that can be applied **element-wise** to vectors and matrices. This is useful if you want to return an object the same size as the one you are testing. For example, the following produces a vector of absolute values from a vector[^abs]

```{r}
x <- runif(6, -1, 1)
x
ifelse(x < 0, -x, x)
```

[^abs]: note that in practice, absolute values can be returned more easily using the `abs()` function e.g. `abs(x)`

## User defined functions

R also allows you define your own `functions`, that take a set of arguments and return some output. For example,

```{r}
## define a function that takes a number and returns whether
## the number is greater than, less than or equal to 0
sign_num <- function(x) {
    if(x < 0) {
        print("x is less than 0")
    } else {
        if(x == 0) {
            print("x is equal to zero")
        } else {
            print("x is greater than 0")
        }
    }
}
```

This piece of code is broken down as follows:

* The `function(x)` part defines a `function` object that takes an argument `x`. Whatever variables are defined here are **local** variables, i.e. they only exist within the function, and are destroyed once the function exits. 
* The first set of curly brackets then denote which lines of code are part of the function.
* The function then takes the local variable `x`, and using a series of nested `if`/`else` loops, prints out whether the number is greater than, less than or equal to zero.
* When the code hits the final curly bracket, the function exits.
* The function is stored (using the assignment operator `<-`) into an object called `sign_num`.

We can then use this function by simply passing values to it:

```{r}
sign_num(1)
sign_num(-1)
sign_num(0)
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
By default, an R function returns the final line as its output. In the example above, no object was present on the final line, so R returned nothing. A useful habit to get into is to use explicit `return()` statements to denote what object is returned from a function.
```

The following code returns the **absolute value** of `x`, as well as printing information on whether the original `x` was greater than, less than or equal to zero:

```{r}
## define a function that takes a number and returns whether
## the number is greater than, less than or equal to 0
sign_num <- function(x) {
    if(x < 0) {
        print("x is less than 0")
    } else {
        if(x == 0) {
            print("x is equal to zero")
        } else {
            print("x is greater than 0")
        }
    }
    return(ifelse(x < 0, -x, x))
}
sign_num(-1)
```

```{info, title = "Aside", collapsible = FALSE}
A really useful function in R is called `paste()`. This allows us to concatenate objects into strings, which is particularly useful for printing to the screen. For example:
    
``{r}
x <- 10
paste("The variable x is", x)
``

We can see that this has taken the value of `x` (which is `r x`), and created a character vector of length 1 containing the concatenated string `"The variable x is 10"`. Notice by default that `paste()` inserts a space between the arguments it's concatenating, this can be suppressed using the `sep` argument, or by using the `paste0()` function e.g. note the difference between the first function and the latter two (which are equivalent) below:

``{r}
paste("x =", 1)
paste("x =", 1, sep = "")
paste0("x =", 1)
``

```

```{task}
Try the following pieces of code. What do they do?
     
1. `paste("Here is a number:", 1:10)`.
2. `paste(1:10, collapse = " + ")`.
3. `paste("Here are some numbers:", paste(1:10, collapse = ", "))`.
4. `x <- 1:10;`
  `paste("The sum of the first", length(x), `
      `"numbers is given by", paste(1:10, collapse = " + "),`
      `"=", sum(x))`
      
```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = FALSE}
## 1. This creates a character vector of length 10 where each
## element is the result of pasting "Here is the number:" 
## with each number 1 to 10 respectively
paste("Here is a number:", 1:10)

## 2. This creates a character vector of length 1 that 
## has the numbers 1 to 10 separated by "+" signs
paste(1:10, collapse = " + ")

## 3. This creates a character vector of length 1 that 
## prints a message followed by the vector separated
## by commas (uses nested functions)
paste("Here are some numbers:", paste(1:10, collapse = ", "))

## 4. This creates a long string which concatenates
## various functions of a vector (length, sum etc.)
## together to form a description of adding numbers
## together. Uses nested functions.
x <- 1:10
paste("The sum of the first", length(x), "positive integers is given by", 
      paste(1:10, collapse = " + "), "=", sum(x))
``

```

Outputs from R functions can be passed into other objects e.g.

```{r}
y <- -1.3
absy <- sign_num(y)
```

```{r}
y
absy
```

Here we pass a variable `y` to our function, and because R creates a **local variable** inside the function, the original value of `y` remains unchanged once the function has been run. The absolute value is calculated and then passed into a new variable `absy`. R also allows variables to be overwritten, hence the following code overwrites `y` with its absolute value:

```{r, results = "hold"}
y <- sign_num(y)
y
```

If you wish to exit an R function earlier than the final line, perhaps due to some conditional statement, then the `return()` function can be used to do this e.g.

```{r}
whoknows <- function(x) {
    for(i in 2:x) {
        if(x %% i == 0) { 
            return(i) 
        }
    }
}
```

```{r}
whoknows(10)
whoknows(17)
```

```{task}
What is the `whoknows` function defined in the above piece of code doing?
```

```{solution}
It is taking a number and printing out the first number > 1 that divides `x` to leave a whole number.
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
The `stop()` function is useful as a way of stopping the code if some condition is breached, and thus facilitates **error checking**. It takes a character argument that it prints to the screen if it is run (see below for examples).

There is also a useful `stopifnot()` function, which takes a conditional statement as an argument and stops the code if the statement is not true. This is particularly useful as a quick way of checking inputs, and is less verbose than `stop()`. However, the latter function allows you to write more informative error messages, and so is preferred, particularly if you want to share your code with others.
```

Notice that our functions have been quite sloppy so far, and really we should check that the variables that we are entering into the function are of the correct form. A better piece of code is:

```{hypertarget, label="tidyscript"}
```

```{r}
whoknows <- function(x) {
    ## check `x` variable is present
    if(missing(x)) {
        stop("'x' is missing")
    }
    
    ## check `x` is numeric
    if(!is.numeric(x)) {
        stop("'x' must be numeric")
    }
    
    ## check `x` is of length one
    if(length(x) != 1) {
        stop("'x' must be of length 1")
    }
    
    ## check `x` is an integer
    if(x %% 1 != 0) {
        stop("'x' must be an integer")
    }
    
    ## check `x` is larger than 1
    if(x < 2) {
        stop("'x' must be larger than 1")
    }
    
    ## print out the first number > 1 that
    ## divides x to leave a whole number
    for(i in 2:x) {
        if(x %% i == 0) { 
            return(i) 
        }
    }
}
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
whoknows()
whoknows(10)
whoknows(2.5)
whoknows(-1)
whoknows("bob")
whoknows(c(10, 17))
```

```{task}
Write an R function called `checkprime`, that takes a single argument `x`, and returns whether `x` is a **prime number** or not. The function should check whether `x` is a single positive integer > 2 and return an error if not. [**Hint**: copy the `whoknows` function into your R script file and use this as the basis of your new function.]

Use it to check whether the following numbers are primes:

1. 3891
2. 7103
3. 7919
4. 10535

```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = FALSE}

```

## Using `apply()` functions

There are several ubiquituous functions that you'll see used often in R code, I'll introduce four main ones (though there are others): `apply()`, `lapply()`, `sapply()` and `tapply()`.

Their sole *raison d'&ecirc;tre* (as far as I can tell) is to make code more concise. Essentially they allow you to replace the use of a loop with a single line of code that aids legibility. They do not (as far as I'm aware) make the code faster.

For ultimate speed, one always wants to try to use **vectorised** operations in R, but sometimes looping over various margins of an object can be useful, and these functions can help.

### `apply()`

The `apply()` function applies a function to either rows or columns of a matrix (in fact it applies to any dimension of an `array`, but we will restrict ourselves here to `matrix` types only). For example, consider that we have a matrix `x` as below:

```{r}
x <- matrix(1:12, 3, 4)
x
```

Now we might want to calculate the **mean** say, of each **row**, in which case we could write a loop:

```{r}
## set output vector
xmn <- numeric(nrow(x))

## calculate mean for each row
for(i in 1:nrow(x)) {
    xmn[i] <- mean(x[i, ])
}

## print means
xmn
```

Note that here we had to set up an output vector (`xmn`) and then populate it with values. We used ***vectorised*** functions (`mean()`) to calculate the means for each row, but we required a loop to extract each row as a `vector` (the `i`th row is `x[i, ]`). We could do this in a single line using `apply()`:

```{r}
xmn <- apply(x, 1, mean)
xmn
```

Here the first argument to `apply()` is the matrix, the second argument determines the *margin* (`1` for rows and `2` for columns), and the third argument determines the function you want to apply to each row/column (`mean()`), and must take a vector of values as its first argument. To calculate the **means** of each **column** of `x` we can write:

```{r}
ymns <- apply(x, 2, mean)
ymns
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
In practice, since wanting to calculate **means** and **sums** of rows/columns of matrix-like objects is so **ubiquitous**, R provides some specific functions to do this: notably `rowSums()`, `colSums()`, `rowMeans()`, `colMeans()` that are simpler and faster than `apply()` for these specific summary measures.
```

We can also use user-defined functions, for example to divide each row by its sum, we could use:

```{r}
apply(x, 1, function(vec) {
    return(vec / sum(vec))
})
```

Here each row of `x` is passed into our function as a **local** object called `vec`, the function then divides each element of `vec` by its sum and returns the resulting vector. Note that `apply()` returns an output matrix with dimensions `ncol(x)` $\times$ `nrow(x)` here, so we might want to transpose if we want to return in the original dimensions:

```{r}
t(apply(x, 1, function(vec) {
    return(vec / sum(vec))
}))
```

Other arguments can be passed to our user-defined function as extra arguments to apply, as long as the first argument to our user-defined function corresponds to each row/column e.g. to divide each line by a variable `n` we could:

```{r}
t(apply(x, 1, function(vec, n) {
    return(vec / n)
}, n = 10))
t(apply(x, 1, function(vec, n) {
    return(vec / n)
}, n = 2))
```

```{info, title = "Aside: ellipsis (...) arguments", collapsible = FALSE}
Notice that when we ran:

``{r, eval = FALSE}
apply(x, 1, function(vec, n) {
    return(vec / n)
}, n = 10)
``

the `apply()` function does not have an argument called `n`. Our **custom** function does however, and the `apply()` knows to pass `n = 10` through to it. It only knows how to do this through the use of a special argument called the **ellipsis** argument, which is denoted by `...`.

``{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("intro/images/ellipsis.png")
``

**Ellipsis** arguments are very useful, but need to be used with care! They can only be used if a corresponding function has been written to use them, and although they support positional matching, it is often helpful to be explicit and use **named** matching.
```

We can also save our user-defined function as an object and pass it into `apply()` e.g.

```{r}
divn <- function(vec, n) {
    return(vec / n)
}
t(apply(x, 1, divn, n = 10))
t(apply(x, 1, divn, n = 2))
```

```{task}
Use `apply()` to return the range of each column of the matrix `x` defined above. Return as a 2 $\times$ 4 matrix.
```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = FALSE}
t(apply(x, 2, range))
``

### `lapply()` and `sapply()`

These functions essentially do the same thing but on lists, so each element of a list is passed to a corresponding function e.g.

```{r}
x <- list(matrix(1:4, 2, 2), matrix(1:9, 3, 3))
x
```

To get the dimensions of each element of the list we could use something like:

```{r}
lapply(x, dim)
```

We can see that `lapply()` returns a list object with the dimensions. The function `sapply()` is a user-friendly version of `lapply()` that always returns a simpler object than a list if possible e.g.

```{r}
sapply(x, dim)
```

```{info, title = "Note", collapsible = FALSE}
Again, be careful of the format returned by these functions. In this case `sapply()` returns a 2 $\times$ 2 matrix where the dimensions are returned down the columns. If you are in doubt, check with a trivial example like this one.
```

### `tapply()`

A very useful function is `tapply()`. This takes three arguments: the first is a vector of values, the second is a `factor` vector of the same length, and the third is a function. `tapply()` groups the first vector according to the levels of the second vector (the `factor`), and then applies the function to these subgroups. For example, R has a `datasets` package that provides a series of data sets---here we will look at one called `chickwts`.

```{r}
## load the datasets package
library(datasets)

## summarise the chickwts data
head(chickwts)
summary(chickwts)
```

The `chickwts` data set records chick weights in an experiment, where newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into six groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement. Their weights in grams after six weeks are given along with feed types. So if we wanted to measure the mean weight at six weeks for chicks fed different diets, we could use:

```{r}
tapply(chickwts$weight, chickwts$feed, mean)
```

```{task}
The `datasets` package provides data on from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatment conditions (stored as the `PlantGrowth` data set). Summarise this data set and produce an estimate of the mean yield for each experimental group. Generate means and standard deviations for each experimental group.
```

```{solution}

``{r, eval = FALSE}
## summarise data
summary(PlantGrowth)

## generate mean yields per experimental group
tapply(PlantGrowth$weight, PlantGrowth$group, mean)

## generate mean and SD yields per experimental group
## using a user-defined function
tapply(PlantGrowth$weight, PlantGrowth$group, function(x) {
    c(mean(x), sd(x))
})
``

```
